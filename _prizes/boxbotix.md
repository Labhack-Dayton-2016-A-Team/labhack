We plan on having a few [BoxBotix](http://www.boxbotix.com): An Open Source Modular Robotics Platform kits available that individuals with concepts for creative military or civilian use will be able to pitch to potential teams. A description of the kits is [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1853778193/boxbotix-an-open-source-modular-robotics-platform?ref=project_link). The best two pitches will get to use the kits to demonstrate their concept.
